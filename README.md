TechStats.com
=============

StackOverflow.com and Github.com Data Explorer

TechStats.com started off as a university class project by a team five of graduate students. This website acts as a one stop solution for technology utilization comparisions on the major tech sites on the internet. Currently the data for the system is from Stackoverflow.com and GitHub.com. But it has the capability to support other data sources in the future. 

This project used the data dumps of Stackoverflow and Github sites to generate graphical analysis on various categories like programming languages, operating systems, IDE's, databases, etc. Analysis was done to calculate the average response time of various programming languages posted on stackoverflow.com. The top 50 interview questions were also mined, which could be helpful for programmers to attend interviews. The user activity was analysed to know the geographical distribution of the users. 

Hadoop Mapreduce and PIG scripting are used to process the Big Data. The processed data is stored in MySQL. The user interface was developed using HTML5 and CSS3. The web service was written in Java using RESTful framework. The website is currently hosted on cloud. The website can be viewed at : http://trendz.sjsu272.cloudbees.net/

(The project was pushed onto GitHub after it has been completed.)
